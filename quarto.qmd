## BDJ inspection

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bdj<-read_tsv("DS-KROK4BDJ.txt")
column_names <- colnames(bdj)
print(column_names) 
```

So you can see there are quite a few columns in this document.

I believe that most of the columns should be factors for this analysis.

```{r}
head(bdj,5)
```

Flip through the head of the file and see.
